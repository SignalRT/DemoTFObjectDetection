# DemoTFObjectDetection
C# Example using TensorFlow to make Object detection.

The example includes several Models (Trained and Frozen) to be able to test de application as fast as possible.

The application includes a User Interface to capture the camera directly or to process a video file. You can choose also between several models to make the object recognition and a model to make Hand detection.

This example was done in the way to make a clone of amazon go technology and it's just a demo app.
